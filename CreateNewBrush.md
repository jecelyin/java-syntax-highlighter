# Create New Brush #

All the brushes that come with the release are placed under [syntaxhighligther.brush](http://java-syntax-highlighter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/syntaxhighlighter/brush/package-summary.html) package. All brushes should extends the [syntaxhighligther.brush.Brush](http://java-syntax-highlighter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/syntaxhighlighter/brush/Brush.html) class. You can take a look at [syntaxhighlighter.brush.BrushJava](http://code.google.com/p/java-syntax-highlighter/source/browse/trunk/src/syntaxhighlighter/brush/BrushJava.java) to see what should be done to make a new brush.

  * Check out the [List of All Known Available Custom Brushes](http://www.undermyhat.org/blog/2009/09/list-of-brushes-syntaxhighligher/), which includes many brushes that did not (yet) make it to the standard distribution.
  * Check [this wishlist](http://www.undermyhat.org/blog/2009/09/list-of-brushes-syntaxhighligher/#wishes), and vote for it, in case your brush is already wished for before.
  * You can create a brush yourself, see this [handy custom brush guide](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/brushes/custom.html).
